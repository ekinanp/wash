/*
Package plugin defines a set of interfaces that plugins must implement to enable wash
functonality.

All resources must implement the Entry interface. To do so they should include the EntryBase
type, and initialize it via NewEntryBase. For example
	type myResource struct {
		plugin.EntryBase
	}
	...
	rsc := myResource{plugin.NewEntryBase("a resource")}
EntryBase gives the resource a name - which is how it will be displayed in the filesystem
or referenced via the API - and tools for controlling how its data is cached.

Implementing the Parent interface displays that resource as a directory on the filesystem.
Anything that does not implement Parent will be displayed as a file.

The Readable interface gives a file its contents when read via the filesystem.

All of the above, as well as other types - Execable, Stream - provide additional functionality
via the HTTP API.

// Entry is the interface for things that are representable by Wash's filesystem. This includes
// plugin roots; resources like containers and volumes; placeholders (e.g. the containers directory
// in the Docker plugin); read-only files like the metadata.json files for containers and EC2
// instances; and more. It is a sealed interface, meaning you must use plugin.NewEntryBase when
// creating your plugin objects.

// Metadata returns a complete description of the entry. See the EntryBase documentation for more

Parent is an entry with children. It will be represented as a directory in the Wash filesystem.
All parents must implement ChildSchemas, which is useful for documenting your plugin's hierarchy
via the stree command, and for optimizing `wash find`'s traversal by eliminating non-satisfying
paths. Your implementation of ChildSchemas should be something like
	return []*plugin.EntrySchema{
		(&childObj1{}).Schema(),
		(&childObj2{}).Schema(),
		...
		(&childObjN{}).Schema(),
	}

For example,
	return []*plugin.EntrySchema{
		(&containerLogFile{}).Schema(),
		(&containerMetadata{}).Schema(),
		(&vol.FS{}).Schema().SetLabel("fs"),
	}
is the implementation of ChildSchemas for a Docker container.
