Wash is an extendable shell that uses UNIX-y patterns and tools to help you manage your cloud native and non-cloud native things.

# **With Wash**

## Here's how you'd manage AWS

{% include screencast.html name="intro/aws" poster="0:20" %}

## GCP

{% include screencast.html name="intro/gcp" poster="0:21" %}

## Kubernetes

{% include screencast.html name="intro/kubernetes" poster="0:19" %}

## Docker

{% include screencast.html name="intro/docker" poster="0:19" %}

## And Spotify.[^1]

{% include screencast.html name="intro/external-plugins" poster="0:19" %}

## Get started [today]({{ 'installing_wash' | relative_url }}).

[^1]: Spotify isn't one of the shipped plugins; we only included it here to show you that Wash can talk to anything. So if you've got another vendor whose things you'd like to `cd` and `ls` through, narrow down with `find`, read with `cat`, or [more]({{ '/docs#actions' | relative_url}}), then give Wash a try.
