title: Metadata filtering with the meta primary
---
{% include test_environment_reminder.md %}

This tutorial gives a detailed overview of the `meta` primary. The `meta` primary lets you filter entries on their metadata properties, which is useful when you want to filter entries on a non-Wash attribute property. Examples of such properties include vendor-specific things like an AWS EC2 instance’s VPC ID or a GCP compute instance’s service accounts. They also include properties that don't yet exist as Wash attributes, such as a VM or container’s state, labels, and tags.

The `meta` primary is its own mini-DSL (domain specific language). Each `meta` primary expression consists of:
* The specific metadata property that you’re filtering on
* A predicate on that property’s value. 

There are seven possible value types (excluding `Primitive`):
* `Object`
* `Array`
* `Primitive`
    * `Null`
    * `Boolean`
    * `Numeric`
    * `Time`
    * `String`

Each value type comes with its own predicate. For example, you would construct an `Object Predicate` on `Object` values, an `Array Predicate` on `Array` values, a `Numeric Predicate` on `Numeric` values, or a `Time Predicate` on `Time` values. All predicates evaluate to `false` for mistyped values. For example, an `Object Predicate` would return `false` for a `Numeric` value.

Each value predicate can be combined with another value predicate using `find`’s expression operators. For example, the predicate `+1` is a numeric predicate that means `> 1`. The predicate `+1 -a -3` means `> 1 AND < 3`. Similarly, the predicate `+1 -o -3` means `> 1 OR < 3`.

To facilitate the following discussion, we will pretend that we are filtering on Docker containers. We will use the `wash_tutorial_redis_1` container's metadata when constructing our `meta` primary expressions.

**Note:** We’re using the full metadata because a Docker container's partial metadata doesn't have enough interesting properties for a meaningful tutorial. In general, you'd _always_ want to use the partial metadata’s value instead of the full metadata because filtering on the former is much faster: `O(1)` vs. `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of visited entries.

Now say we wanted to filter on a Docker container's platform. From the `meta` output, we see that `Platform` is the desired property, and the value of that property is a `String`. The latter means that we will be using a `String Predicate`. Thus, the `meta` primary expression would look something like

    -meta '.platform' linux

Let’s try it out!

```
wash . ❯ find docker -fullmeta -k '*container' -meta '.platform' linux
docker/containers/wash_tutorial_redis_1
docker/containers/wash_tutorial_web_1
```

**Note:** The `fullmeta` option tells `find` that we are filtering on the entry's full metadata.

Nice! Note that we used the `kind` primary to explicitly indicate that we are filtering on Docker containers. Also note that the `meta` primary will case property names for you, so you don’t have to be too strict when you’re typing them out. This means that something like `-meta '.PLATFORM' linux` or `-meta '.pLaTfOrM' linux` also work.

Now say we wanted to filter on all of our Docker containers whose maximum retry count is less than 1. From the `meta` output, we see that `hostConfig.restartPolicy.maximumRetryCount` is the desired property, and that this property is a numeric value. Thus, the expression would look something like

    -meta '.hostConfig.restartPolicy.maximumRetryCount' -1

where `-1` means `< 1` (see the section on `Numeric Predicates` in the `meta` primary docs).

Let’s try it out!

```
wash . ❯ find docker -fullmeta -k '*container' -meta '.hostConfig.restartPolicy.maximumRetryCount' -1
docker/containers/wash_tutorial_redis_1
docker/containers/wash_tutorial_web_1
```

Nice!

Now say we wanted to filter on all of our Docker containers that have a mount named `wash_tutorial_redis`. From the `meta` output, we see that this information is contained in the `mounts` property. That property’s value is an array of mounts, and each mount is an object. For a given mount, it looks like the `name` would contain the mount's name. From this information, we see that *Return true if the Docker container has a mount named `wash_tutorial_redis`* is equivalent to *Return true if the Docker container's `mounts` property contains at least one element whose `name` property is `wash_tutorial_redis`*.

Now that we’ve more precisely defined our predicate, it is time to construct the `meta` primary expression. Since `mounts` is our property, we’ll start with `-meta '.mounts'`. Since `mounts` has an `Array` value, that means we must use an `Array Predicate`. Since our `Array Predicate` must return `true` if at least one element matches the final predicate, we’ll use `[?]`. Thus, our expression now becomes `-meta '.mounts' '[?]'`.

Each element in the array is an `Object`. That means we must give our `Array Predicate` an `Object Predicate`. Since the `name` property contains the desired information, our expression becomes `-meta 'mounts' '[?]' '.name'`. Since the `name` property is a `String` value, we must give our `Object Predicate` a `String Predicate`. We want to match on `wash_tutorial_redis`, so our expression now turns into

    -meta '.mounts' '[?]' '.name' wash_tutorial_redis

and we are done. We can shorten this expression to

    -meta '.mounts[?]' '.name' wash_tutorial_redis

or even further to

    -meta '.mounts[?].name' wash_tutorial_redis

So the `find` invocation is something like:

    find docker -fullmeta -k '*container' -meta '.mounts[?].name' wash_tutorial_redis

Try it out and see if it works.

That wraps up our discussion on the meta primary’s DSL. We’ll now give you a general overview of how to construct a meta primary expression. Assuming you have a general idea of the specific property that you want to filter on, then here’s what you should do:

1. Find a representative entry that you can use to construct your expression. In our examples, we chose the `wash_tutorial_redis` container.

2. Check that entry’s partial metadata value via `meta --partial` and see if the desired property is there. If it is, then figure out the property value’s type and construct the appropriate predicate. Remember that you can use `find --help meta` to view the `meta` primary’s full documentation.

3. If the partial metadata does not contain the desired property, then you’ll have to check the entry’s full metadata via `meta`. If the full metadata contains the property, then refer to Step 2 and be sure to pass the `-fullmeta` option to `find`’s invocation so that `find` knows that it’ll need to fetch the entry’s full metadata. If the full metadata does not contain the property, then you’ll have to contact the plugin author(s) and ask them if they could include your property’s value in the entry’s metadata.

**Note:** The meta primary should be used in conjunction with the `kind` primary (see Exercise 2 in the [previous tutorial]({{ '/tutorials/02_find/depth-primaries-expression' | relative_url }})). This way, `find` can take full advantage of entry schema optimizations, which is especially useful when the entry's schema doesn't include metadata schemas (possible for external plugins).

# Exercises

{% include exercise_reminder.md %}

1. This exercise is broken up into several parts. Each part will ask you to filter on something specific to a Docker container. Your job is to provide the appropriate `meta` primary expression that accomplishes the given task. For example, a valid answer for "Has `N < 1` maximum retry counts" would be `-meta '.hostConfig.restartPolicy.maximumRetryCount' -1`. Hint: Use the example’s metadata. Remember to set the `fullmeta` option when testing your expressions.

    1. Has `N == 0 AND N < 1` maximum retry counts.

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>-meta '.hostConfig.restartPolicy.maximumRetryCount' 0 -a -1</code>" %}

    2. Has a mount whose name is either `wash_tutorial_redis` or `wash_tutorial_web`

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>-meta '.mounts[?]' '.name' wash_tutorial_redis -o wash_tutorial_web</code>" %}

    3. Was started within the last 4 weeks.

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>-meta '.state.startedAt' -4w</code>" %}

    7. Is not in the `stopped` state.

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>-meta '.state.status' \! stopped</code>" %}

    8. Has the `wash_tutorial_redis` _volume_ mounted. Hint: The predicate is still constructed on the `mounts` property. What’s the property that corresponds to a mount's type?

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>-meta '.mounts[?]' '.name' wash_tutorial_redis -a '.type' volume</code>" %}

2. This exercise is broken up into several parts. Each part will ask you to find entries that satisfy a specific set of criteria. Your job is to provide the appropriate `find` invocation that accomplishes the given task. For example, a valid answer for "Find all EC2 instances with the `project` tag in a given profile" would be `find aws/<profile> -k '*ec2*instance' -meta '.tags[?]' '.key' project`. Hint: The partial metadata should contain what you need.

   **Note:** Even if you're not using a given plugin, we recommend that you take a look at these answers to see the full extent of the `meta` primary's power.

    1. Find all running Docker containers.

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>find docker -k '*container' -meta '.state' running</code>" %}

    2. Find all running GCP compute instances in a given project.

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>find gcp/&lt;project&gt; -k '*compute*instance' -meta '.status' RUNNING</code>" %}

    3. Find all running Kubernetes pods in a given context.

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>find kubernetes/&lt;context&gt; -k '*pod' -meta '.status.phase' Running</code>" %}

    4. Find all GCP storage buckets in a given project that are using `REGIONAL` storage.

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>find gcp/&lt;project&gt; -k '*storage*bucket' -meta '.storageClass' REGIONAL</code>. Remember that the concepts in this tutorial apply to any entry, not just containers/VMs" %}

    5. Find all running Docker containers that were created within the last 24 hours. Hint: Remember the `crtime` primary and `find`’s operators.

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>find docker -k '*container' -meta '.state' running -crtime -24h</code>" %}

    6. Find all running AWS EC2 instances in a given profile that were launched more than a week ago. Hint: You’ll need to use the `meta` primary more than once here.

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>find aws/&lt;profile&gt; -k '*ec2*instance' -meta '.state.name' running -meta '.launchTime' +1w</code>" %}

    7. Find all running GCP compute instances in a given project whose `owner` label is set to `jimmy`.

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>find gcp/&lt;project&gt; -k '*compute*instance' -meta '.status' RUNNING -meta '.labels.owner' jimmy</code>" %}

    8. Find all Kubernetes pods in a given context that have the `owner` label. Hint: It is enough to check that the label exists.

        {% include exercise_answer.html answer="<code>find kubernetes/&lt;context&gt; -k '*pod' -meta '.metadata.labels.owner' -exists</code>" %}
